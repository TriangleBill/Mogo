# layout project "Mogo"

---
## For what?

This project is a mock-up of a single page application with JS scripts. The layout is adaptively rebuilt depending on the width of the user's screen.

At the beginning of the page, a header is fixed, with which navigation through the application is carried out. When the screen width is 750px or less, the navigation is hidden behind the burger.


## Application launch.

To view the layout, just run "index.html" in the root folder.
